# Cyclistic_case_study_2024
Google data analytics course - Capstone project

Introduction
This is the capstone project fo the google data analytics course on coursera. In this project wrap-up, I will analyze a fictional cyclistic bike-share company
and come up with recommendations regarding their business task.

Scenario
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. 
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diŦerently. From theseinsights, your team will design a new marketing strategy 
to convert casual riders into annual members. But ůrst, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Company
Cyclistic is a company that launched in 2016 a bike-share offering. Customer can buy single-ride, full-day or annual membership 

Context and Business task
Cyclistic’s finance analyst have concluded that annual membership are much profitable than casual riders. The company now want to convert casual riders into members. 
In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders diŦer, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could aŦect their marketing tactics

Data sources used
We used the data source from the company’s data. The previous 12 months of cyclistic data are located at the amazon web service.

Challenges
No price data
As we don’t have the casual ride nor annual membership prices, we couldn’t evaluate the outcome of having membership compare to casual for the whole year.

No distinct user info 
We have data for all ride in 2023 but we couldn’t figure out how many user exactly went for those rides
